git reset "version-id" <option>

version-id  -   can be got by "git log --oneline --graph --all -decorate" command

option can take values --soft / --mixed / --hard

--soft  -   this will preserve the changes that you have made in the working directory as 
            well as in the staging area (ie a status will still show the latest changes that 
            you have made in the working directory as well as staged (add .) but uncommitted
            changes)

--mixed -   this will preserve the changes that you have made in the working directory ONLY,
            any changes that you have made to the staging directory but are uncommitted will
            have been reset (still would be in the working directory though)

--hard  -   this will NOT preserve any changes that you have made, any change to the working 
            or to the staging directory would have all been entirely lost and would be reset 
            to the status at the point given by the "version-id"

git reflog      /    git reflog show HEAD

Reflog tracks Git refs updates to any repository branch. In both the above two commands, 
they point to the reference logs to the HEAD directory.

In addition to branch tip reflogs, a special reflog is maintained for the Git stash (in 
case a stash is being maintained by the "git stash" command).
